 Secure Registration Backend
1. Description
This application is a Spring Boot-based project that enables user registration and login functionality with email validation. The primary purpose of the application is to provide users with the ability to register, log in, and authenticate with email verification. The application is built with Spring Boot, Spring Security, Spring Data JPA, and PostgreSQL, and it also uses email functionality for account confirmation.

1.1 Technologies Used
Backend: Spring Boot 3.4.1
Database: PostgreSQL (JPA)
Email Service: Spring Boot Email Integration
Security: Spring Security (for user authentication)
Logging: Spring Bootâ€™s built-in logging mechanism
Other Libraries: Lombok (for reducing boilerplate code)

2. Project Setup
2.1 Prerequisites
JDK 21 or higher
Ensure Java Development Kit (JDK) 21 or higher is installed.

Database

PostgreSQL: Set up a PostgreSQL database. The application is configured to use PostgreSQL as its data source.
Maven

The project uses Maven for dependency management.
SMTP Server

The project is configured to use a local SMTP server for email sending. (Can be replaced with any SMTP provider for production)

5. APIs
5.1 Registration Endpoint
URL: POST /api/v1/registration
Request Body:
json
Copy code
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com",
  "password": "password123"
}

6. Security
6.1 Authentication
The application uses basic authentication with Spring Security. It supports user login and logout.

6.2 Password Storage
Passwords are stored securely using BCryptPasswordEncoder, which hashes passwords before storing them in the database.

6.3 Role-Based Access Control
The application uses role-based access control (RBAC) for authorization. By default, users are assigned the USER role upon registration.

7. Email Configuration
7.1 SMTP Setup
The project uses a local SMTP server running on port 1025 for sending registration confirmation emails. Modify the application.yml file for production SMTP services (e.g., Gmail, SendGrid).
Name-maildev
using Node.js
commend - 1 npm install -g maildev
2 maildev
3 copy MailDev webapp running at http://localhost:1080/ (web Address)
